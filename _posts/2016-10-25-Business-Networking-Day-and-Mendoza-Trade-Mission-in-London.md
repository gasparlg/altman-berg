Since 2009 this annual event has attracted an important critical mass of speakers and audience. On the first day of the event the following distinguished speakers will give a dissertation about the future of the commercial relationship between Argentina and the UK, Carlos Sersale Di Cerisano, Argentine Ambassador in London; Sir Michael Rake, Chairman BT; The Rt Hon Sir Alan Duncan MP, Minister of State for Europe and the Americas at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office; and Mariano Mayer, National Secretary for Entrepreneurship & SME of Argentina. 

Representatives of the province of Mendoza will be present to talk about business opportunities in their province. The speakers will be Gabriel Fidel, Chairman Pro-Mendoza; Fernando Urdaniz, Manager Pro-Mendoza; and Andrés Perez Díaz, Vice Chairman Asociación de Ejecutivos de Mendoza. At the event there will also be special dissertations about specific industries and presentations on how to set up businesses in the UK and how to export to Argentina and the UK.

In 2014, both countries had a combined bilateral export trade of over $1,370,000,000, and current data from key industries shows that the trade between the two nations is growing. The Argentine wine industry is expected to export a total of $160,000,000 for 2016 to the UK, being the second most important export market after the U.S. for this industry.

Since the election of the new Argentine government last year, both countries are promoting an expansion of bilateral commercial development and investment, with the goal of building stronger business ties. Currently over 100 UK companies operate in Argentina. This includes small and medium sized UK companies and more than 30 FTSE 100 companies such as BT, GSK, HSBC and Unilever.
